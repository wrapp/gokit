/*
Handy methods for environment variables.
The idea of using this package is to unify all env related functions. It also provides a
wrapper of os.Getenv() just because if a developer wants to get an environment variable
then he does not need to include an extra import. Although developer is free to use
any way he wants. This package does not restrict the usage of getting the environment
variable.
